# Python LCDproc Client

A simple library I've whipped up to add some functionality to my
LCDproc server.  General parts are pulled out and should work on any
display.

## included utilities

A few generally useful utilities:
 - lcdmessage shows a message for a brief period on the foreground, good for alerts

## plans

Risking God's laughter:
 - 'make install'
 - mythlcdstatus summarizes MythTV recording status, next upcoming recording
